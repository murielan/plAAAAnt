== PlAAAAnt - Mobile App

## Overview
The android app "PlAAAAnt" is designed for you to get screamed at (get notifications) when one of your plants is running low on water. Originally developed collaboratively in the FHNW module ws6C FS23, I continue its development independently.

## Features

- Feature 2: Usage of an external sensor to measure the humidity and send it to a broker
- Feature 3: Receive humidity via broker subscription
- Feature 4: Get notifications on low humidity
- Feature 5: Add, edit or delete plants (in development)
- Feature 6: Login (in development)
